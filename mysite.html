            <p class="subsec small">Seed is technically defined as ripened ovule containing embryo.
                Seed is the most important and vital input for agricultural production.
                In fact, it is the most cost efficient means of increasing agricultural production and productivity.
                Seeds Efficacy of other agricultural inputs in enhancing productivity and production, such as
                fertilizers, pesticides and irrigation is largely determined by the quality of seed.
                Quality of seed accounts for twenty to twenty five percent of productivity. It is, therefore, important
                that quality seeds are made available to the farmers of the country.
                The Indian Seeds programme recognizes three generations of seeds, namely, breeder, foundation and
                certified seeds.
                For ensuring sustainability the seed supports high productivity, enhancing profitability, creating
                bio-diversity at a reasonable level and gives environmental protection.
                the seed technological point of view seed may be sexually produced matured ovule consisting of an intact
                embryo, endosperm and or cotyledon with protective covering (seed coat).
                Thus seed is the most vital and crucial input for crop production, one of the ways to increase the
                productivity without adding appreciably to the extent of land now under cultivation by planting quality
                seed.

            <p class="sectiontag large">Fertilizers</p>
            <p class="subsec small">Fertilizers are chemical substances supplied to the crops to increase their
                productivity. These are used by the farmers daily to increase the crop yield. The fertilizers contain
                the essential nutrients required by the plants, including nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. They
                enhance the water retention capacity of the soil and also increase its fertility.
                Fertilizers increase plantsâ€™ tolerance towards pests. This has reduced their reliance on insecticides
                and herbicides, thereby, producing healthier crops. Consequently, diseases have reduced, providing
                aesthetic value to the crops.
                Fertilizers improve the water holding capacity of the plants and increase root depth.
                The potassium content present in the fertilizers strengthens the straws and stalks of the plants.
                The phosphorus present in the fertilizers helps in the faster development of roots and formation of
                seeds in the plants.
                Nitrogen in the fertilizers enhances the growth of the plants which can be characterized by the green
                colour of the plants.
                Since the chemical fertilizers adversely affect soil fertility, biofertilizers were brought into use.
                These are substances that contain living or latent cells, and even micro-organisms. They provide the
                soil with the necessary nutrients and microbes for the growth of the plants. They help the soil to
                retain its fertility. They are environment-friendly and also destroy pathogenic components responsible
                for causing disease in plants. Acetobacter and Rhizobium are two such widely used biofertilizers.

            <p class="sectiontag large">Pesticides</p>
            <p class="subsec small">A pesticide is any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing,
                destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest (epa.gov).
                Pests can be defined as any organism that causes plant diseases. Agricultural pesticides are then those
                chemicals that are used by farmers to prevent
                the effectivity of the pests on the growth and productivity of agricultural crops.
                Pesticides are made up of active and inert ingredients. There are certain labeling requirements for the
                commercial distribution of products that used agricultural pesticides.
                The active ones are those which do the damage to the pest, federal law mandates that these ingredients
                be clearly labeled on the packaging. Inert ingredients are not required
                to be labeled as they do not cause harm, they are usually present as a solvent in the solution. (inert
                ingredients are not necessarily non-toxic).
                All pesticides must be registered with the EPA before they can be sold or distributed. There are many
                tests and requirements concerning the potential effects of the pesticides in order to be approved.
                Pesticides can be incredibly beneficial and have most certainly increased food production
